Current limitations
===================

.. _limitations-label:

Uniform Vertical Grid
---------------------

The algorithm used in xomega currently only supports input on uniform vertical grid.
Calculation using data on non-uniform grid will give no error but the discretization error may be significant.

Rigid-lid Boundary Conditions
-----------------------------
Currently, only rigid-lid boundary conditions are implemented.
